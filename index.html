  <p>This is not my first website, chances are if you're seeing this I've added the JS features that I didn't really understood but I added them anyway because they looked cool. Just being honest here.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Disclaimer: I did not understand the JS on this site.</li>
    <li>The html/css part I did understand, I will recreate this on a codepen that I will link somewhere on my twitter.</li>
    <li>MDN is a solid resource so far.</li>
